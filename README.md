### 👋 Hey there!

I'm Mariana. I recently became a WebDev after participating in the "Albañiles-Digitales/Software-Builders" Bootcamp. It was a great opportunity for me to dive into the world of programming and learn about this fascinating field. Before that, I studied Nutrition, another great science. I hope you enjoy my projects as much as I enjoy creating them.

Something you should know about me: I'm focused on becoming an amazing Full-stack WebDev!

- 🔭 I'm looking for a job opportunity to gain experience and continue learning.
- 💻 I'm recently finished an internship in the area of project management and applications using React (Mancomunidad de la Comarca de Pamplona).
